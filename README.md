This project analyzes Netflix's dataset to derive insights using advanced data analysis techniques. Key tasks include data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends in content distribution by genre, release year, and region. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight patterns in user ratings and popular content. Statistical methods and Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas are leveraged for in-depth analysis, providing data-driven insights to inform strategic decision-making.
